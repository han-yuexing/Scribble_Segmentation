# Scribble_Segmentation
Purpose
The PTS model aims to supplement insufficient supervision in line-annotated learning with pseudo-annotation generated by the model. The software is capable of performing simple test inferences on trained models within a Windows system, displaying, and saving the segmentation results.

Core Program Files

main_material.py: Entry point for model training and testing, with some hyperparameters available for runtime parameters.
attention.py: Implementation code for the PTS auxiliary branch.
dataset.py: Reads image data and converts images stored in the data directory into training and testing inputs.
utils.py: Contains implementations of various data augmentations.
unetpp.py: Implementation code for the PTS main branch.
metrics.py: Custom loss function and metric calculation implementations.
Data Directories
Directories for titanium alloy and ceramic images with training and testing annotations.

Requirements
Lists the Python environment requirements for running the software.

Methods and Algorithms
Describes the computer image processing and deep learning algorithms used, including data augmentation, main branch (using a pretrained backbone unet++ network), auxiliary branch (feature embedding convolution, distance measurement and generation), and prediction segmentation.

Software Interface and Code Explanation
The interface allows for the use of trained models for prediction on other images without GPU requirements. The program code includes all the original and supplementary code files necessary for running training and testing.

Functions Explained
Details on the functions for reading runtime parameters, loading main and auxiliary branch models, building local image datasets, validation, training, testing, and adjusting learning rates.
